This repository contains an R script and dataset used for predicting energy consumption with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree models. The dataset (energydata.csv) includes various features related to energy consumption, which are used to train the machine learning models. The R script implements preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of both SVM and Decision Tree algorithms. This project demonstrates the comparison and performance evaluation of these models for energy consumption prediction.
